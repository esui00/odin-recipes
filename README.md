# odin-recipes

Project: Recipes | The Odin Project

I have a good understanding of the basics of HTML and CSS
but I am still getting used to using VSCode to make commits.
Pushing onto Github is still a WIP.

Cloned this project done entirely on a Linux VM onto my Windows Host to try to see if I could make edits, and push this commit.
